# RSA

I wrote this program because of my tragic happening.
At the end of this semester, I received a e-mail from the TA of the course, Digital Design,
and they thought that I was the suspect copying other student's code or giving other student my code.
(The attachment is a picture, showing the similarity of our code.)
That student's name is Chen BAI XUN and I even hadn't heard this name before.
I thought it was ridiculous that the TA told me that I would be flunked if we didn't tell the truth clearly and immediately.
However, I didn't know this person. Why I gave the person my code? And I couldn't copy his code, too.
I angryly screen shot, and posted the e-mail on my Instgram.
Later, I got a phone call.
The voice was so familiar that I knew it was the person acqainted with in the art club.
At the moment, I had a ominous presentiment.
He said that he gave Chen BAI XUN my code and felt nothing but guilty.
Memory flushed into all my mind. I finally figured out what happened.
I had given this guy my code, because I thought it was ok to gave a stutent not study this class.
And also I thought he was honest and a little pitiful...

At the night after the things happend, I called my Mom in tears, thinking that was so unfair.
It was really a hard time waiting for the judgement.
Under this stress, I also had to prepare for the final exam.
It was actually the terrible period I had never experienced in my life....

The professor didn't flunk me, but I thought that I had learned more than a lesson counted for 3 credits.
(Ha ha...)then this unsecured RSA encoder was created.
I used 5 binary bits to encript text.(Normally using 1024 binary bits, but I had limited time. It is summer vaccation...)

Note: in this project, there is a function called "exp_mode" written by others. I found it when someday I browsed Yahoo page.
